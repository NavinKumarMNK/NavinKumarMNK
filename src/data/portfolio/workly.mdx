Slicing Design with Tailwind CSS and React.

Things I've learned so far:

- CSS Grid
- Optimize React Performance, `React.useCallback`, `React.lazy`, `React.Suspense`, and wrapping up components with `React.memo`
- Lazy Loading image with `react-intersection-observer`
- Animation with Framer Motion
